# iOS Image Picker Crash Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **iOS 14+ Photo Library Permissions**

-  **Problem**: Missing proper permission descriptions in `app.json` for iOS 14+'s granular photo access
-  **Solution**: Added comprehensive permission descriptions in `app.json`:

   ```json
   "NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription": "Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your photos for image selection and upload.",
   "NSCameraUsageDescription": "Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to use your camera for taking photos.",
   "NSMicrophoneUsageDescription": "Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your microphone for video recording.",
   "NSFaceIDUsageDescription": "Give $(PRODUCT_NAME) permission to access your Face ID biometric data for secure authentication."
   ```

### 2. **Memory Management Issues**

-  **Problem**: High quality settings (`quality: 1`) causing memory pressure on iOS devices
-  **Solution**:
   -  Reduced quality to `0.7` for optimal balance between quality and memory usage
   -  Disabled EXIF data (`exif: false`) to reduce memory footprint
   -  Disabled base64 encoding where not needed (`base64: false`)

### 3. **Error Handling Improvements**

-  **Problem**: Inconsistent error handling across image picker implementations
-  **Solution**: Created `ImagePickerUtils` class with comprehensive error handling:
   -  Proper permission status checking
   -  Graceful error recovery
   -  User-friendly error messages
   -  iOS 14+ compatibility

### 4. **iOS 14+ Granular Permissions**

-  **Problem**: App not handling "Select Photos" vs "Full Library Access" permission model
-  **Solution**: Enhanced permission handling that:
   -  Checks current permission status before requesting
   -  Provides clear guidance for denied permissions
   -  Handles both limited and full access scenarios

## Files Modified

1. **`app.json`** - Added iOS permission descriptions
2. **`lib/image-picker-utils.ts`** - New utility class for iOS-compatible image picking
3. **`components/profile/ProfileImageUpload.tsx`** - Updated to use new utility
4. **`app/(root)/service-creation/verify-identity.tsx`** - Fixed memory issues and error handling
5. **`components/common/image-upload.tsx`** - Improved error handling and memory management

## Testing Instructions

### 1. **Clean and Rebuild**

```bash
# Clean iOS build
cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..

# Clean Expo cache
npx expo start --clear

# Rebuild iOS app
npx expo run:ios
```

### 2. **Test Permission Scenarios**

#### Test Case 1: First Time Permission Request

1. Delete app from device/simulator
2. Install fresh build
3. Try to select image
4. **Expected**: Permission dialog appears with proper description
5. **Expected**: App doesn't crash after granting permission

#### Test Case 2: Permission Denied

1. Deny photo library permission when prompted
2. Try to select image again
3. **Expected**: Clear error message with guidance to enable in Settings

#### Test Case 3: iOS 14+ Limited Access

1. Grant "Select Photos" permission (not full library access)
2. Try to select image
3. **Expected**: Works correctly with limited access

#### Test Case 4: Large Image Handling

1. Select a very large image (10MB+)
2. **Expected**: Image is compressed and processed without crash

### 3. **Memory Testing**

1. Select multiple large images in succession
2. Monitor memory usage in Xcode Instruments
3. **Expected**: No memory spikes or crashes

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Monitor Crash Reports**

-  Use Firebase Crashlytics or similar to monitor for any remaining crashes
-  Look for specific error patterns related to image picking

### 2. **Performance Optimization**

-  Consider implementing image caching for frequently used images
-  Add image size validation before processing
-  Implement progressive image loading for better UX

### 3. **User Experience Improvements**

-  Add loading indicators during image processing
-  Implement image preview before upload
-  Add image compression options for users

### 4. **Testing on Different Devices**

-  Test on older iOS devices (iPhone 8, iPhone X)
-  Test on different iOS versions (14.0, 15.0, 16.0+)
-  Test with different image formats (HEIC, JPEG, PNG)

## Troubleshooting

### If Crashes Still Occur

1. **Check Console Logs**

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device
   # Check Metro bundler logs for JavaScript errors
   ```

2. **Verify Native Build**

   ```bash
   # Ensure native modules are properly linked
   npx expo prebuild --clean
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

3. **Check Memory Usage**

   -  Use Xcode Instruments to monitor memory
   -  Look for memory leaks during image processing

4. **Test with Different Images**
   -  Try different image sizes and formats
   -  Test with corrupted or unusual image files

## Key Changes Summary

-  ✅ Added proper iOS permission descriptions
-  ✅ Implemented iOS 14+ compatible permission handling
-  ✅ Reduced memory usage with optimized quality settings
-  ✅ Added comprehensive error handling
-  ✅ Created reusable image picker utility
-  ✅ Fixed inconsistent implementations across components

The app should now handle image selection reliably on iOS without crashes, even after granting permissions.
